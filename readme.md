### Code to explore the Benfords law paradox
Code is expected to calculate to an average of 602.2.  The code calculated with randint varies with the run, but is usually in the low 300s.  This does not confirm the Benfords law.
- Possible Inconsistency:
  The calculated code doesn't approach 300 (the theoretical prediction) and hovers in the 320-350 range. This may be because the first number can never be 0, while the remaining numbers can include 0.
